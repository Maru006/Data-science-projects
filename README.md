# variability-in-temperature-forecast
The objective of this project looks into generating a weather report database and a method that visualizes this data with minimal manual coding.

Currently, it relies on a few lines of code ran at console level. This requires basic to no knowledge of coding, but expects a python software or an IDE to function.

In the future, this would be available as an application that would be ran at desktop user-interface level, with options that can automate daily data gathering tasks and one-click visualization icons.
