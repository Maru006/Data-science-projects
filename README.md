# variability-in-temperature-forecast
The objective of this project looks into generating a weather report database, and a method to visualizing this data with as few manual coding as possible. 

Currently, it relies on few lines of code ran at console level. Execution requires basic to no knowledge of coding, but expects a python software to run at console.

In the future, this would be available  as an application that can be run at user-interface level, with options that can automate daily data gathering tasks.
